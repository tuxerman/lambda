- Keep stirring the thing aorund like a risotto, and when it starts getting a bit viscous, take it off the heat. Continue stirring, and pop it back onto the stove, etc.

- Once you've got to a decent consistency, add a tablespoon of crème fraîche and the chopped chives.
- Serve with toast or whatever is crisp and can be bitten into.
